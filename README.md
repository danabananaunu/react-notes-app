This project is a React-based notes application developed as part of a comparative study of modern frontend frameworks. The application allows users to create, edit, delete, search, and filter notes, with all data stored locally in the browser. 

• Notes can be created with a title, text content, optional tags, and optional file attachments
• Notes can be edited and deleted, with all changes reflected immediately in the UI
• A search bar allows real-time filtering of notes based on title and content
• Tag-based filtering allows narrowing down notes by selected tags
• All notes are persisted using browser local storage, so data remains after page reloads
• File attachments are handled on the client side and associated with individual notes

To run the application locally, Node.js and npm must be installed on the system. The node_modules folder is intentionally not included in the repository and must be installed locally.

• Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine
• Navigate into the project folder
• Install dependencies using: npm install
• Start the development server: npm run dev
• Open the application in the browser using the local development URL provided by Vite
